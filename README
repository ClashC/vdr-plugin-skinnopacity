Requirements
------------

- VDR version >= 1.7.30

- Installed ImageMagick for displaying png/jpg Icons, Channel Logos and EPG Images

- VDR Plugin epgsearch for displaying the progress bar in the schedulings "what's now" display.

Description
-----------

"nOpacity" is a highly customizable native true color skin for the Video Disc Recorder.

Installation 
------------

After "normal" Plugin installation you have to care about the paths for the
used Icons, the channel logos and epg images. The following paths can be set
at startup:

-i path, --iconpath=path
    Path to the icons (Default: <vdrconfdir>/plugins/skinnopacity/icons/).

-l path, --logopath=path
    Path to the logos (Default: <vdrconfdir>/plugins/skinnopacity/logos/).

-e path, --epgimages=path
    Path to the epgimages (Default: <vdrconfdir>/plugins/skinnopacity/epgimages/).

First copy the icons from 
/put/your/path/toVDRsources/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src/skinnopcaity/icons/
to the configured icon path. After that download the logopack from:
http://www.dvbviewer.tv/forum/topic/21378-logopacks/
unzip it and place it accordingly the settings for the channel logos path.

if no pathes are set for the different types of images, the following default
paths are used:
channel logos: {ResourceDirectory}/logos/
icons:		   {ResourceDirectory}/icons/
epg images:	   {CacheDirectory}/epgimages/

If directories for channel logos, icons or epg images are set via startup 
parameters, images are searched first in these directories. If the image
is not available, an additional search in the according default directory
will be performed.
With this it is possible to use user images and images provided by a
package maintainer or distributor in parallel.

For S2-6400 Users: Disable High Level OSD, otherwise the plugin will not be
loaded because lack of true color support

Usage
-----

After installation first activate then skin in the VDR OSD menu. nOpacity scales to 
every screen resolution, but in lower resolutions than 1920 * 1080 it may be necessary
to change some default settings for dimensions and font sizes to achieve the best result
(see "setup options" below).

nOpacity respects the OSD settings for OSD top, left, width and height. If these values
are not set to top&left: 0, width&height: 100, you'll get a border around every displayed
skin element. Additionally you are able to configure an individual border for almost every
displayed skin element (channel switching, recordings, volume, audio tracks) in the 
skin setup. Only the menu uses the full screen if not configured differently in the 
OSD settings.  

As already mentioned, font sizes are customizable via the skins setup menu. The skin 
calculates the font sizes for the used screen resolution individually. The value
for the different font sizes in the setup options is always the delta to the calculated
(default) values. If you set a value for a font size of -2 for instance, the default
font size is decreased by 2, analogue the font size will be increased by setting a 
positive value.

As described in "installation", you should use a special channel logo pack with transparent
channel logos. In this logo pack all files are named only with lower case letters. 
nOpacity uses the channel name CONVERTED TO LOWER CASE LETTERS to search for aT 
appropriate channel logo. With this, approximately 90% of the channel logos should work 
immediately after placing the channel logos in the correct place. So if you have to change
the name of a channel logo (may be by inserting a space or a hyphen) so that it fits to
the channel name, only use lower case letters, and not the name of the channel with upper 
and lower letters as displayed inside VDR.
Additional hint: some channels have slashes in their name (in germany nick/comedy for instance).
In this example, as a dirty hack just create a folder in your channel logo directory named 
"nick" and place an image named "comedy.png" inside this folder.

With softhddevice as output plugin, use a Version newer than Revision f640ebde 
(0.5.1, 10.10.2012) to achieve a correct display of the screen resolution during channel switching.
