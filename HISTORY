- Fixed a bug that fade in time for channels switching was not stored
- Fixed a bug that signal strength and screen resolution are not shown if
  fade in time was set to zero.
- Fixed a bug that Title was not shown when displaying a EPG Search Result
- Fixed a bug that VDR crashes if empty channels where shown in "What's next"
- Fixed a bug that VDR crashes if channels named "." where shown in 
  Channels menu
- Fixed a bug that display for jumping in recordings was not shown
- Changed default path for channel logos, icons and epg images. FHS standard
  introduced in VDR 1.7.30 is used.
  channel logos: {ResourceDirectory}/logos/
  icons:		 {ResourceDirectory}/icons/
  epg images:	 {CacheDirectory}/epgimages/
- If directories for channel logos, icons or epg images are set via startup 
  parameters, images are searched first in these directories. If the image
  is not available, an additional search in the according default directory
  will be performed.
  With this it is possible to use user images and images provided by a
  package maintainer or distributor in parallel.
- rewrote column width handling so that for calculating the width of a column
  the actually used font size is used.
- if the width of the text in a column in a default menu is lager than the
  width of the column itself, the text is cutted to an appropriate width.
- implemented cSkin::GetTextAreaWidth() and cSkin::GetTextAreaFont()
- added patch that scales video display into the visible frame
  if a narrow menu is displayed. Thanks @Zoolook for providing this patch.
- added a setup option which allows to enable / disable this video scaling
- Avoided some compiler warnings
- Clear Message Box in Menu also if Caller not clears it himself
- Fixed bug when calculating height of schedules menu item

  (thanks @maverick-me)
